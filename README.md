- Implement a simple HTML/CSS/JS app that will apply a filter to an image using pure JS
   - A user will be able to select an image from the local filesystem
   - The app will process and apply a image filter
   - The app will display the transformed image
   
- Use WebWorkers to avoid blocking the UI while the picture is being processed
